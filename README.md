<b>More information</b>
The application itself is simple. The signup/login screen is handled by the FireBase Database using their Authentication system. The application receives information regarding the user from the database. I have filled this information in within Firebase. If I were to develop this application futher I would have added another screen to allow for the user to add accounts with their relevant information.

The user is able to add monetary value to the plan value and they are also able to log out.

With this file is the option to also view the database (Firebase) in real time whilst the app is running. If you would like access to this, feel free to contact me.
